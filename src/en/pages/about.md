> Hey Rafa, do you know how to make web sites?

> Sure, how can I help you?


That was back in 2016, in a meeting at home where my dad asked me that question. Although I spent (and spend) time on the computer, at that time I did not have the slightest idea of how to make a website, but fortunately a couple of searches on Google and Youtube helped me and that's how I started in this world of web development. Now several years later I can say that I got a taste for creating websites that help people and companies to reach their goals.

As every tutorial said, I started with basic HTML and CSS (with frameworks like Bootstrap and Bulma) and then a bit of JavaScript. But, as what I was asked for was something closer to a blog, I went straight to Wordpress, and there it also opened a wide world of possibilities. That's how my first job and project came out: the blog of the [Fundación Arquitectura y Ciudad](https://fundaayc.com/). Of course it was originally a blog `.wordpress.com`, but over time it grew and in 2022 I moved to a more formal domain and we improved the hosting plan.

With that blog set up, I kept practicing with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and some Git (and participating in [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) courses), and was filling a folder with sample projects. At about the same time I was also playing with local WordPress development (since I didn't have enough income to pay for a hosting plan) using [Local](https://localwp.com), and by 2020 a friend contacted me to ask if I knew how to use WordPress. This time I said yes without it being a bluff. Then I started working freelance as a Webmaster/IT Specialist for [Credit Restructuring Solutions](https://www.creditrsllc.com/), at first I was making a couple of changes to a pricing table for a secondary page they had, then I went on to do maintenance and complete redesign of the main page and other sites they manage, also I made some websites for the clients they help.

By 2021 I came across the idea of Jamstack and little by little I've been implementing it in the projects I work with. Of course, I also work with WordPress but I'm tipping the balance in favor of Jamstack related frameworks. In fact, this portfolio is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I hope to continue using these and other related technologies to keep doing interesting projects.
