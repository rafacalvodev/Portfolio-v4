This is a minimal starter for localized content with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

It uses Eleventy's own [Internationalization (I18n) plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/i18n/), which is bundled with Eleventy as of version 2.0.

You may want to read the [companion article on my personal website](https://www.lenesaile.com/en/blog/internationalization-with-eleventy-20-and-netlify/), where I build the starter and explain all the decisions that were made throughout the process.
